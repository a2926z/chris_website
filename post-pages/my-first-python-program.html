          <b>My first Python project</b>   was a classic simple game that many beginners create when learning the language. The
            computer randomly selects a number from 1 to 99, and the user has seven attempts to guess it. I chose seven
            because it allows you to always win if you go to the middle of the range each time. For example, you start
            with 50, and if the computer says "higher," you go to 75, and so on.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>This was the</b>   first time I used while loops and functions that run when called. It was also my first time
            converting a .py file to an executable (.exe) to run on computers without Python installed.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
         <b>For this, I used</b>    the well-known PyInstaller, which can be quite troublesome. Firstly, it doesn't create a
            single .exe file if you have images or other files in your program, so you need to carry all of them
            together with the .exe in a .rar file or something similar.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Secondly,</b>   some antivirus software, including Google's, incorrectly identify your .exe file as a virus.
            Google is not an antivirus, but it won't allow you to send the .exe file via email or even share it through
            Google Drive.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>The solution?</b>   You can do two things. First, upload the file to <a
                href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload" target="_blank"> <b>VirusTotal</b> </a>,
            see which antiviruses recognize it as a virus, and send a false positive report, at least to the major
            antiviruses widely used.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>To share a program,</b>   first compress it with a password and then upload it to Google Drive or any server you
            have for sharing. Personally, I use Microsoft's OneDrive, which provides 5 GB of free space and works great.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>If you're interested,</b>   you can download the game's exe file <a
                href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApZtI3LNpx79gQLjhYH9g54P7y3E?e=43r7UY" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
            It doesn't require installation and is completely safe, although Google may flag it as an uncommon download.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Overall, this project</b>   was a great learning experience for me. It allowed me to gain familiarity with
            important concepts such as loops, functions, and executable file conversion. I also learned about some
            potential challenges in sharing my program with others, such as antivirus software false positives. However,
            by using tools like VirusTotal and password-protecting compressed files, I was able to overcome these
            challenges and successfully share my project with others.
