            <b>A contact form</b> is an essential component of any website. It needs to look professional and perform
            its
            primary function of facilitating easy and secure communication between visitors and site administrators. In
            this post, we'll create a fully functional contact form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the free
            formsubmit.co service. The resulting form will be user-friendly and provide a seamless communication
            experience for your site visitors.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>The HTML page</b> is the easy part. We'll create a button that opens up the popup contact form, and a
            form tag
            with inputs for all the information we need from the user. Specifically, this form asks for their name,
            email, and message as the only inputs required. Finally, we'll create the button that sends the message. The
            HTML code for this page will look something like this:
        </p>

        <pre class="post-text">
            <code class="language-html">
            &lt;button id="open-popup" class="btn"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/button&gt;

            &lt;div class="popup" id="popup"&gt;
              &lt;div class="popup-container"&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Contact Me&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;form id="contact-form" action="https://formsubmit.co/your-random-like-string" method="POST"&gt;
                  &lt;!-- CAPTCHA enabled for now, disable unchecking the code below --&gt;
                  &lt;!-- &lt;input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false"&gt; --&gt;
                  &lt;input type="hidden" name="_autoresponse" value="
                  Thank you for your message, I will be in touch with you shortly.
                  "&gt;
                  &lt;input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://a2926z.github.io/chris_website/"&gt;
                            
                  &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
                  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name" required&gt;
            
                  &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
                  &lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required&gt;
            
                  &lt;label for="message"&gt;Message&lt;/label&gt;
                  &lt;textarea id="message" name="message" placeholder="Enter your message" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
            
                  &lt;button type="submit" class="submit-btn"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
                &lt;a class="close" href="#">&amp;times;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;</code>
        </pre>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>The only thing</b> that requires explanation is the "your-random-like string" found in the form's action.
            After creating the form and submitting a test message, formsubmit.co will send a confirmation email to the
            email address you provided for receiving messages. Upon confirming the email, you will receive a second
            email containing a unique string of letters and numbers, referred to as "your-random-like string". This
            string needs to be added to your HTML page instead of your personal email address. By doing so, your email
            address will remain hidden from spammers who may try to view it in the page's code. However, you will still
            be able to receive messages through formsubmit.co as usual.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            After finishing your HTML page, the next step is to focus on CSS. This is where you can inject your unique
            style or seek assistance from others. In my case, I requested help from ChatGPT to refine my CSS, and I must
            say, the outcome was exceptional. The finished code is available at the conclusion of this article, hence I
            won't delve into further specifics at this point.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>JavaScript</b> has three main tasks to perform. It can open the form as a popup, close it, and check for
            any
            errors in the email. Additionally, it can close the form if you click outside of it and prevent the page
            from scrolling to the top if you simply close the form, which is the default behavior. All of these actions
            require approximately 20 lines of code, which are presented below.
        </p>


        <pre class="post-text"><code class="language-javascript">
            $(document).ready(function () {

            // Open popup
            $("#open-popup").click(function () {
              $("#popup").fadeIn(300);
            });
          
            $("#popup, .close").click(function (event) {
              if ($(event.target).is("#popup, .close")) { // Check if click is outside of form or on close button
                event.preventDefault();
                $("#popup").fadeOut(300);
              }
            });
          
            // Form validation
            $("#contact-form").submit(function (event) {
              var email = document.getElementById("email").value;
              if (!/^([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$/.test(email)) {
                alert("Please enter a valid email address.");
                return false;
              }
            });
          
          });</code></pre>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>Finally</b> , setting up the form submission functionality is really simple, as we explained earlier.
            Instead of
            requiring registration, you just need to configure the action attribute of the form tag like this:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="post-text" style="text-align: center;">
            action="https://formsubmit.co/your-email-address"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="post-text">
            After confirming your email, you'll receive a unique and
            bolded string to replace "your-email-address" with. This helps keep your real email address hidden from
            spammers. And that's it – you're almost ready to go!
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>Additional</b> settings allow you to automate your responses, disable CAPTCHAs (although not recommended
            by
            formsubmit), and create a new "thank you" page where users can see that their message has been successfully
            sent, among other optional configurations. Personally, I found it helpful, after the message, to
            auto-transfer the user to my main page and set up an automated response that reads, 'Thank you for your
            message, I will
            be in touch with you shortly.' For more optional settings, you can find them all on their
            webpage <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Remember to include</b>   your personal details such as your email address, your unique string of characters, and the
            URL of your website in the respective fields. Additionally, it's important to link your CSS and JS folders
            to your HTML page to ensure proper functioning. This contact form works smoothly with Gmail too. You can
            easily download the complete code, comprising all the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, from 
            <a href="https://github.com/a2926z/contact-form" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>
            and use it as per your requirements. To test the form, head to the bottom of my <a href="https://a2926z.github.io/chris_website/"><b>main
                page</b></a> and give it a shot.
