          <b>You create a</b>   free template blog. You give all your time and love in it. You fill it with good, original
            content. You search. You struggle. You send it to whatever free already established webpage there is. But
            guess what. After months and months you have 2 visitors per day. You think: "it's the template's fault. Full of
            bugs and ads. Fuck it".
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>You learn HTML, CSS, Javascript.</b>   You start again from zero and create line by line a new, handsome, fast
            blog. You add the old content and new one, narrating your journey to all those unknown till yesterday to
            you, things. You add all your pages in google search console the way Google advices you to. You do all that
            there is. And guess what happens.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>You guessed right.</b>   No visitors. Do you know why? I am gonna tell you right now.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>The whole system </b>  is built on 1 thing: consumption. And what fuels consumption? That's right: Ads. So, the
            deal is this: you enter this system or fail. You pay for the people to get to know you or disappear. And who
            should you pay? That's right: Google.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>So, lets go again. </b>  You create a free, great blog and pay a lot of money in Google, Youtube, Facebook, etc,
            ads and <b>if</b>  you have interesting content, people <b>may</b>  get to know you. You don't pay and nobody cares whatever
            content you may have. It's that simple. The times that good content itself had visitors has gone for good.
        </p>

          <b>So the decision is yours. I made mine.</b>
