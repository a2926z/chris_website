          <b>The Turtle Crossing</b>   exercise in Python is of moderate difficulty. It's one of those exercises where if you
            can solve the basic problem, the rest comes easily. It's a classic arcade game that we used to play as kids
            in electronic stores with the twenty-drachma coin, not the twenty-euro one. I'm talking about the old silver
            coin that was the ticket to paradise for kids back then.

         <b>The game was</b>    built using the Turtle library, and the main issue concerns the number of cars being produced.
            If a new car is created with every screen refresh (0.1 seconds), you will have 600 cars on your screen every
            minute, causing unbearable congestion and preventing the game from progressing. On the other hand, if you
            increase the screen refresh rate, the game runs poorly and appears to "freeze".

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>This is a classic</b>   programming problem that requires "out of the box" thinking to solve. The solution
            involves using random draws. Instead of creating a new car each time the production function runs, a draw is
            made from numbers 1 to 5, for example, and a car is only produced when the number 3 is drawn. This restricts
            new cars by 80%, and your screen refresh rate remains normal.
