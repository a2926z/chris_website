          <b>I've just completed</b>   the 150th and final exercise of Nichola Lacey's fantastic book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Example-Nichola-Lacey/dp/1108716830/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1DL6LTZIYZ3NN&dchild
            =1&keywords=python+by+example&qid=1614015793&sprefix=python+by%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-5"
                target="_blank"><b>"Python by Example"</b></a>. In
            this exercise, I was tasked with creating a fully functional database for a hypothetical art gallery, which
            allows users to search based on four different criteria - artist, medium, price (greater than or less than),
            and also add or remove art pieces or artist contact information.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
           <b>To build this</b>  application, I used Tkinter for the graphical interface, SQLite for the database, and wrote
            297 lines of Python 3 code. This was the first project that I've worked on by request, even if it was just
            an exercise in a book.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>This was a challenging</b>   exercise for a new programmer, especially figuring out how to make a search button
            call four different functions instead of just one. Then, I had to tackle the graphical interface, where the
            search and other buttons would be placed etc.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>The end result</b>   isn't that bad for just 2 days' worth of work. Despite the simple graphic environment, what
            matters is that a fully functional database was created that can handle millions of records with complete
            search and add/remove functionality for all elements.
        </p>

            users to modify it according to their needs.
