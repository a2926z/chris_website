         <b>The Simon Game</b>    is an intermediate level exercise in JavaScript that tests memory. It is a memory game that
            increases in difficulty as you play. On the webpage, four colored squares with different sounds each,
            appear.
            The computer randomly chooses a color, you press it, then it selects another, and you press that too,
            continuing in the same manner. This creates a pattern that you must remember. Every time you correctly
            select the pattern, you advance to the next level, and a new color is added to the existing ones.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>This game is</b>   recommended by experts as particularly beneficial for improving memory, especially for older
            people who need to exercise their minds. An average user can progress up to level 10-15 with a little
            practice. Someone with a particularly good memory will go beyond level 20. Of course, the final score
            depends on the randomly created pattern, some of which are very difficult, while others are easier.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>In terms of</b>   programming, two lists of colors are created: the one generated by the computer and the other
            selected by the player, and they are compared throughout the game. If they are equal, the game continues;
            if not, it's Game Over and you start from the beginning. All of this is done in 134 lines of code, which are
            available <a href="https://github.com/a2926z/a2926z-SimonGame" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.
