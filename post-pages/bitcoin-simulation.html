         <b>The concept of a random walk</b>    is familiar to those who have the misfortune, or perhaps fortune, of dealing
            with artificial intelligence. Those in the know are aware that today (as of February 2022), it is highly
            unlikely that any AI model can beat the naive model. And what is the naive model? It's the "prediction" of
            an algorithm that the next value will be the same as the previous one. This is how embryonic AI currently is
            with regard to predicting stock prices.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Therefore, under</b>   certain circumstances, a random walk, i.e. the random fluctuation of prices, can provide
            answers about the future if combined with the past. So what are these circumstances? Let's take a look...
        </p>

        <img src="../post-images/bitcoin-simulation2.webp" class="post-img" alt="">

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>Requirement 1:</b> First, let's establish some facts about Bitcoin. In July 2010, the value of Bitcoin
            was only one cent of a dollar. However, ten years later, its value had skyrocketed to around $10,000, with a
            peak high of $20,000 at the end of 2017. For the purposes of our analysis, we'll focus on the closing value
            of $10,000 and ignore the peak high of $20,000.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Next, we'll examine</b>   the daily fluctuation rate, which is determined by a coefficient of change, denoted as
            "r". This coefficient regulates the daily price fluctuations within a certain range. For instance, if r =
            5%, the daily fluctuation cannot exceed +5% or -5%. A higher coefficient results in greater price
            volatility, which can lead to more extreme prices. However, we'll impose one condition: in our simulation,
            no price can exceed that of Bitcoin. Essentially, we'll treat Bitcoin as a ceiling that cannot be surpassed
            by any other cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>To meet this condition,</b>   we ran a simulation twenty times, with 10,000 cryptocurrencies each, and varied the
            coefficient of change from 1% to 10%, starting at a value of one cent. After completing the simulations, we
            found that the cryptocurrency with the highest return rate (Bitcoin) achieved the coveted average value of
            $10,000, ten years later, with a coefficient of change of 4.1%. This allowed us to determine the range of
            fluctuations that led Bitcoin to its frenzied growth during the decade from 2010 to 2020.

         <b>Now that we have</b>    found the exact coefficient that determined the performance of Bitcoin, we move on to the
            second requirement.

        <p class="post-text">
            <b>Requirement 2:</b> The coefficient "r" that guided Bitcoin during its 10-year maturation period will
            continue to do so in the future.

        <br>

        <p class="post-text">
         <b>This requirement</b>    generates much discussion because Bitcoin may not exist in 10 years or may have returned to
            being worth only one cent, or there may not even be a planet with people on it capable of using it. However,
            the phrase "let's assume that" is used here.
        </p>
        <br>



        <p class="post-text">
          <b>For the second</b>   requirement, I took the golden coefficient "r" (4.1%) that is theoretically in effect since
            Bitcoin is currently a reality, and ran a simulation of 100,000 coins with an initial value of one cent for
            5, 10, 15, and 20 years in the future, based on the year 2010.

            <b>median:</b> The median is the middle value when the sorted list of crypto values is arranged in ascending
            order. For example, if we take a look at a 10-year period, the median is 0.38, which means that if you
            randomly select a cryptocurrency today, there is a good chance that its value will increase by 38 times in
            10 years.

          <b>Some of the simulation's</b>   elements are truly impressive, such as the likelihood of your initial capital being
            multiplied by 1000 in 20 years with a 54.5% probability. Even more impressive is the fact that a digital
            currency with no intrinsic value can go from $0.01 to $10,000 in just 10 years, so it's not surprising that
            it
            could reach $530,000 in 2025.

          <b>This article concludes</b>   with the third and most crucial prerequisite of all: cryptocurrencies remaining
            mainstream and not being replaced by something else, or not being globally banned. If any of these things
            happen, the above simulation becomes irrelevant. Bitcoin's popularity and dynamic is what brought it to
            where it is today. If anything changes, or if restrictive laws are imposed globally, Bitcoin and
            cryptocurrencies in general will weaken and eventually disappear. At present, there is no sign of such a
            thing happening, but data changes rapidly, so the only certain things are death and taxes.

            <b>Jan 2023 Update:</b> Almost a year after running the simulation above, much has happened on planet Earth,
            from wars and destruction to the universal ban on cryptocurrencies in major markets like China and the
            reordering of the global status quo. Bitcoin is still here, alive but wounded. The r factor of the 2010-2020
            decade seems to have abandoned it for good, and it is unlikely to reach the simulation's prices. By the end
            of 2025 and '30, we will be here to observe the current prices, readjust coefficients, and draw our
            conclusions.
